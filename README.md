# Piano

## Notes

- Bootstrap by [fe-base](https://github.com/funsideprojects/fe-base) v1

- Instrument samples came from [tonejs-instruments](https://github.com/nbrosowsky/tonejs-instruments)

- Difference between **.mp3** and **.ogg** files:
  - **OGG** is an open-source format that supports two to 256 channels with better sound quality and smaller compressed file.
  - **MP3** is an open-source format that can support two discrete channels, it also supports joint-stereo, however, is has inferior sound quality.
